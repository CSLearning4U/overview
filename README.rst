Overview of the Runestone Components
====================================

This is a small project that illustrates the various components of the Runestone Writing tools.

Getting Started
===============

We have tried to make it as easy as possible for you to build and use this book.  

1. You can see and read this book online at `interactivepython.org <http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/overview/index.html`>_

2.  You can build it and host it yourself in just a few simple steps:

    1.  ``pip install -r requirements.txt``  -- Should install everything you need
    2.  ``runestone build`` -- will build the html and put it in ``./build/overview``
    3.  ``runestone serve``   -- will start a webserver and serve the pages locally from ``./build/overview``
